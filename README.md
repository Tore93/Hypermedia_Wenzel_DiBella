# Hypermedia_Wenzel_DiBella
Project repository for Hypermedia Tim Project Delivery 

Our Template is not based on any bootstrap and we didn't use any external JS files.
It has been easier for us to write all CSS/JS files manually to better match the website to our MockUp.

Our WebSite files are all in WEBSITE folder.

We used JQuery library to load all pages dinamically , using also Javascript to manage those calls.
Data content is all loaded from our MySQL database using ajax , php and JQuery. The sql DB is in folder "DB".

The WebSite is responsive for all devices.

We created the Android compatible apk.
